initial_description = """You open the creaking cast iron gate and step into
what is now your domain. It isn't much, and you knew that going in, but it sure
as hell is more than you ever had before. The place is looking a bit desolate,
the stables are in much need of repair and there is dirt and litter everywhere. But
this is what you fought for. This is why you denied yourself every pleasure for
the past five years, this is why you worked three jobs that you hated. This is
the moment where you close to the door on your past.

You're home."""
